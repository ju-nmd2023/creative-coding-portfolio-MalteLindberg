The version to the right has a bit more variation, with wiggly lines that randomizes every time you click on it. Additionally, there's a slider to control the rotation of the squares."

    "description": "Version 2 of the 10 PRINT recreation. This version builds the artwork tile by tile, with a slight delay between each tile being drawn. This actually resembles the way the original 10 PRINT program would have generated the pattern on a Commodore 64, where the pattern would appear gradually as the program ran. This can be showcased in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo"
